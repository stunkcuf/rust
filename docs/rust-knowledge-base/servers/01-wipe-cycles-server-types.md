# RUST Server Types & Wipe Cycles Guide

## Understanding Wipes

### What is a Wipe?
A wipe is a server reset that removes progress. There are two main types:

#### Map Wipe
**What Gets Deleted**:
- All player buildings
- All player items and inventories
- All loot containers
- All deployed items
- Tool cupboard authorizations
- Sleeping bags and beds
- Vending machines
- Everything physical on the map

**What Persists**:
- Learned blueprints (unless blueprint wipe)
- Player reputation (some servers)
- Server statistics (kills, playtime)

**Frequency**: Varies by server, minimum monthly (force wipe)

#### Blueprint Wipe (BP Wipe)
**What Gets Deleted**:
- All learned blueprints and crafting recipes
- Essentially resets crafting progression completely

**What Persists**:
- Nothing carries over from crafting/progression

**Frequency**: Periodic, decided by Facepunch Studios OR server owners
- Official: Every 2-3 months typically
- Community: Varies, some never BP wipe

## Force Wipe Schedule

### Official Force Wipe
**Date**: First Thursday of every month
**Time**:
- 19:00 GMT / 14:00 EST / 11:00 PST (approx)
- 2:00 PM EST / 7:00 PM GMT (common reference)

**Mandatory**: ALL official Facepunch servers must wipe
**Scope**: Map wipe mandatory, BP wipe only when announced

### Why Force Wipes Exist
1. **Fresh start**: Levels playing field
2. **Performance**: Clears accumulated entities
3. **Map generation**: New maps with updated monuments
4. **Server health**: Removes lag and bloat

##### Role-Play (RP) Servers

- **For**: Social gameplay, different experience

##### PvE Servers
- No player-vs-player combat

- Cooperative
- **For**: Relaxed gameplay, building without raid fear

##### Solo/Duo/Trio Servers
- Group size limits enforced
- Balanced for smaller groups
- **For**: Solos who hate clans

### Server Selection Factors

#### Population
- **High Pop (200+)**: Constant action, high competition, queues
- **Medium Pop (100-200)**: Balanced, good action
- **Low Pop (<100)**: Quieter, more farming-focused

**Wipe Day vs. Mid-Wipe**:
- Wipe day = high pop
- Mid-wipe = lower pop (dead server)

#### Map Size
- **Small (3000m or less)**: Constant PVP, hard to hide
- **Medium (3500-4000m)**: Balanced, most common
- **Large (4500+)**: Spread out, easier to hide, performance issues

**Recommendation**: 3500-4000m for best performance and balance

#### Region
- **US**: American player base
- **EU**: European player base
- **AS**: Asian player base

**Ping Matters**: Stay below 100ms for PVP viability

#### Admin Activity
- **Active admins**: Handle cheaters, issues quickly
- **Inactive admins**: Cheaters run rampant
- **Check reviews**: See if admins are trusted

#### Plugins & Mods
**Common Helpful Plugins**:
- TP (teleport home)
- Remove tool (fix building mistakes)
- Kits (starter gear)
- Shop (buy items with currency)
- Skills (RPG-like progression)

## Wipe Day Strategy

### Hour 1 (Critical)
- Spawn in fast
- Grab cloth, wood, stone immediately
- Build tiny starter base or find temporary shelter
- Get stone tools
- Secure sleeping bag down

### Hours 2-4 (Establishment)
- Build main starter base (2x1 or 2x2)
- Farm basic resources
- Craft level 1 workbench
- Research/unlock key items: code lock, furnace
- Start farming scrap

### Hours 5-12 (Growth)
- Upgrade to stone
- Farm monuments
- Unlock weapon BPs (revolver, SAR, etc.)
- Get components for better gear
- Expand base or move to better location

### Day 1 Summary
**Minimum Goals**:
- Stone base with code locks
- Level 1 Workbench (ideally Level 2)
- Basic weapon BPs
- 1,000+ scrap banked
- Furnaces running

### Week 1 (Momentum)
- Level 3 Workbench
- Sheet metal upgrades
- AK/LR-300 BP
- Raid materials gathered (sulfur)
- PVP kits ready

### Server-Specific Adjustments

#### Weekly Wipe
- Rush everything day 1
- PVP immediately day 2
- Raiding starts day 3
- Server dies day 6-7

#### Monthly Wipe
- Take day 1-2 to build properly
- Week 1 = establishing
- Week 2 = PVP and raiding prime time
- Week 3 = Raiding slows, population drops
- Week 4 = Nearly dead, waiting for wipe

## Blueprint Wipe Impact

### What BP Wipes Mean
Complete progression reset - everyone starts from scratch with blueprints

### How to Prepare (If You Know BP Wipe Coming)
**You Can't Prepare (Everything Gets Wiped)**

### BP Wipe Day Strategy
1. **Farm scrap aggressively** day 1
2. **Prioritize tech tree unlocks**: Code lock, furnace, weapons
3. **Research key finds**: If you find AK or good weapon, research immediately
4. **Share BPs**: Have teammates research different items

### BP Wipe vs. Regular Wipe Differences
- **Regular wipe**: Use your BPs, craft fast, progress quickly
- **BP wipe**: Everyone on equal footing, much slower progression

## Server Decay Rules

### What is Decay?
Buildings deteriorate over time without maintenance (adding resources to TC)

### Decay Rates by Material
- **Twig**: Hours (extremely fast)
- **Wood**: 2-3 days
- **Stone**: 4-5 days
- **Sheet Metal**: 8+ days
- **Armored**: 12+ days

### Preventing Decay
1. Keep Tool Cupboard stocked with materials
2. Check TC regularly
3. Stock for multiple days if going offline
4. Use upkeep calculator (external tools)

### Upkeep Costs
**Larger base = more upkeep required**
**Sheet metal/armored = expensive upkeep**

**Example (2x2 stone base)**:
- ~200 stone/day
- ~50 metal frags/day
- ~10 wood/day

### Server Modifiers
- **Vanilla**: Standard decay
- **Modded**: Often 0.5x decay (slower) or even no decay

## Choosing Your Server

### For New Players
- **Official 2x weekly** OR **Community 2x weekly**
- Weekly wipe reduces grind
- 2x makes learning less painful
- Fresh starts let you try again
- Population stays active

### For Intermediate Players
- **Official monthly** OR **Community 5x weekly**
- Monthly for full experience
- 5x for PVP practice without grind

### For Experienced Players
- **Official vanilla monthly**: True competitive experience
- **High pop weekly**: Constant PVP action
- **Solo/duo/trio specialized**: Balanced fights

### For Casual Players
- **PvE servers**: No raid stress
- **Low pop community**: Relaxed pace
- **High gather rate**: Less grind, more building

### For Clans
- **High pop monthly**: Dominate server, big wars
- **Official servers**: Most competitive
- **Max group servers**: No team limit

## Red Flags (Servers to Avoid)

- Admin abuse reports
- Pay-to-win shops (buy weapons with real money)
- Dead mid-wipe consistently
- Fake player counts
- Extremely toxic community (check reviews)
- No anti-cheat
- Abandoned (owner offline for weeks)

## Finding Servers

### In-Game Browser
- Filter by region, pop, map size
- Sort by player count
- Read description carefully

### External Sites
- Just-Wiped.net
- Battlemetrics
- Rust-Servers.info

**Check**:
- Wipe schedule
- Rates
- Plugins
- Reviews
- Population history

## Season/Wipe Cycle Planning

### Monthly Wipe Cycle Strategy

**Week 1**: Everyone playing, high competition
- Build fast
- Compete for monuments
- Expect PVP everywhere

**Week 2**: Peak action
- Raiding starts in earnest
- PVP hottest
- Most fun week

**Week 3**: Population drops
- Easier farming
- Less competition
- Some quit waiting for wipe

**Week 4**: Low pop
- Server feels dead
- Good for building/farming
- Prep for next wipe

### Optimal Play Patterns

**Hardcore**: Play week 1-2 hard, quit week 3-4
**Casual**: Play week 2-3, skip wipe day chaos and late-wipe dead period
**Dedicated**: Full month, adapt strategy each week
**Opportunist**: Join week 2, raid weakened bases, less grind needed
