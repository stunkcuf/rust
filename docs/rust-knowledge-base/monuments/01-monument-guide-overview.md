## Scrap Farming Routes & Optimization

### Low-Risk Route (Beginners/Solos)
**Path**: Gas Station → Supermarket → Mining Outpost → Recycle at Outpost
**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Scrap**: 100-200
**Risk**: Very low
**Best for**: Starting out, quick runs

### Medium-Risk Route (Monument Loop)
**Path**: Harbor → Satellite Dish → Power Plant → Recycle at safe zone
**Time**: 20-30 minutes
**Scrap**: 300-500
**Risk**: Medium - other players likely
**Bring**: Hazmat, weapon, meds

### High-Yield Route (Risky)
**Path**: Train Yard → Airfield → Water Treatment → Recycle
**Time**: 30-45 minutes
**Scrap**: 600-1,000+
**Risk**: High - PVP expected
**Bring**: Full kit, hazmat, extra meds

### Underground Tunnels (Uncontested)
**Location**: Beneath roads, multiple entrances
**Loot**: Military crates, tool boxes, barrels
**Scrap per run**: 200-400
**Risk**: Low-Medium - fewer players
**Unique**: Loot carts, tunnel dwellers (NPCs)

**Strategy**:
- Enter via surface entrances
- Bring low-grade fuel for trains
- Run trains station-to-station
- Most peaceful farming option

### Underwater Labs (Clan/Duo)
**Location**: Ocean, use submarine or diving tank
**Scrap per run**: 3,000+ (full clear for squads)
**Risk**: High - Scientists, clans camping, drowning
**Time**: 40-60 minutes

**Loot**:
- 11 crate types
- Multiple keycard rooms (green, blue, red)
- Elite crates
- Heavy scientists

**Resets**: Approximately every 40 minutes

### The Excavator

**How to Use**:
1. Insert diesel fuel
2. Select ore type
3. Activate excavator
4. Collect from output conveyor

**Risk**: EXTREMELY HIGH
- Loud and obvious
- Attracts all nearby players
- Requires holding area while running
- Best for clans with defenders
