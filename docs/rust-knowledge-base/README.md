## Quick Start Guide

### Brand New to RUST?
1. Start with **[Progression System](core-mechanics/01-progression-system.md)** - understand how advancement works
2. Read **[Building Tiers](building/01-building-tiers-and-upgrade.md)** - learn base fundamentals
3. Study **[Survival Systems](survival/01-healing-food-environmental-systems.md)** - stay alive
4. Check **[Server Types](servers/01-wipe-cycles-server-types.md)** - pick your first server

**Recommended First Server**: 2x Weekly Community Server (faster learning, frequent fresh starts)

### Returning Player (2025 Updates)?
Focus on these changed systems:
1. **[Weapons Tier List](combat/01-weapons-tier-list-2025.md)** - Recoil system changed post-2022
2. **[Base Designs 2025](building/02-base-designs-raid-defense.md)** - Current meta strategies
3. **[Monument Guide](monuments/01-monument-guide-overview.md)** - Updated loot and strategies

### Planning Your Wipe?
Use these for strategic planning:
1. **[Monument Guide](monuments/01-monument-guide-overview.md)** - Choose base location near optimal monument routes
2. **[Base Designs](building/02-base-designs-raid-defense.md)** - Select base design for group size
3. **[Progression System](core-mechanics/01-progression-system.md)** - Plan tech tree unlocks
4. **[Resource Gathering](resources/01-resource-gathering-guide.md)** - Optimize farming routes

## Server Type Adaptation

This knowledge base covers strategies for all server types:

### Vanilla (1x)
- Follow all guides as written
- Expect full time investment
- Long-term progression

### 2x Servers
- Progression 50% faster
- Slightly less grind
- Same strategies apply

### 5x Servers
- Fast progression
- Focus on PVP sections
- Less focus on farming optimization

### 10x+ Servers
- Near-instant progression
- Pure PVP focus
- Building and combat guides most relevant

**Key Principle**: Core mechanics remain the same, only gather rates change. Strategies adapt based on how quickly you can acquire resources.

## Current Meta Highlights (2025)

### Building Meta
- **Compact and fully upgraded** > large and weak
- **Stability bunkers** still viable but require precision
- **Trap integration essential**: Shotgun traps, auto-turrets, tesla coils
- **Airlock visibility**: Peek holes and windowed doors meta
- **Economic raid value**: Make base "not worth raiding"

### PVP Meta
- **Post-2022 recoil**: Randomized patterns, tap/burst/crouch meta
- **Top weapons**: AK (mastery required), LR-300 (easier alternative), Thompson (best budget)
- **Attachments critical**: Muzzle brake essential on AK/LR
- **Mushroom healing**: 1/second consumption, faster than syringes

### Progression Meta
- **Tech tree required**: T2/T3 workbenches now locked behind tech tree (2025 change)
- **Scrap tea mandatory**: +50% scrap from all sources
- **Monument optimization**: Train Yard, Military Tunnels, Underwater Labs highest yield
- **Research priorities**: Code lock → Furnace → Weapons → Armor

### Monument Meta
- **Underwater Labs**: 3,000 scrap/hour for squads (highest yield)
- **Underground Tunnels**: Safest farming with good returns
- **Launch Site + Scrap Tea**: 2,000+ scrap/hour solo (high risk)
- **Safe zone recycling**: Outpost/Bandit for risk-free recycling
