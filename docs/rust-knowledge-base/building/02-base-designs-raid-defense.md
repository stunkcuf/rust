# RUST Base Designs and Raid Defense (2025 Meta)

## Current Meta Overview (2025)

The 2025 building meta emphasizes:
- **Strategic airlocks** with visibility
- **Advanced bunker entrances**
- **Hidden loot rooms**
- **Trap corridors**
- **Stability bunkers** (still viable)
- **Compact efficiency** over massive compounds
- **Honeycomb patterns** (triangular/hexagonal)

**Major 2025 Change**: Roof stability exploit fix reduced some creative freedom but improved balance.

## Base Design Fundamentals

### Core Principles
1. **Tool Cupboard (TC) Protection**: Most critical - always armored room, multiple layers
2. **Honeycomb Defense**: Empty layers around core increase raid cost
3. **Airlock Systems**: Prevent door camping and ensure you don't lose entire base to one door
4. **Loot Spreading**: Never store all loot in one room
5. **Maze Interior**: Confuse raiders about optimal path
6. **Trap Integration**: Shotgun traps, turrets, flame turrets
7. **Vertical Layers**: Multi-story for more raid paths needed
8. **Peak-down Advantage**: Design for defensive shooting angles

### Building Sizes

| Footprint | Best For | Typical Rooms | Honeycomb Layers |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| 1x1 | Starter, Outpost | 1-2 | 1 |
| 2x1 | Solo starter | 2-4 | 1-2 |
| 2x2 | Solo/Duo | 4-8 | 2-3 |
| 3x3 | Duo/Trio | 9-16 | 2-4 |
| 4x4+ | Clans | 16+ | 3-5 |

## Honeycomb Strategies

### What is Honeycomb?
Empty walls/floors/ceilings surrounding your core that raiders must breach to access loot. Each layer multiplies raid costs.

### Honeycomb Patterns

#### Square Honeycomb
```
[Wall] [Wall] [Wall]
[Wall] [Core] [Wall]
[Wall] [Wall] [Wall]
```
- Simple to build
- Uniform raid cost from all sides
- Uses more resources for coverage

#### Triangle Honeycomb
```
     [Tri]
  [Tri][Core][Tri]
     [Tri]
```
- More efficient than squares
- Angled walls can deflect rockets
- Slightly more complex to build
- Better resource-to-raid-cost ratio

#### Hexagonal Honeycomb
```
   [Hex] [Hex]
[Hex] [Core] [Hex]
   [Hex] [Hex]
```
- Most efficient pattern
- Maximum raid cost per material
- Asymmetrical - confuses raiders
- Complex to build correctly

### Honeycomb Tips
1. **Layer count matters more than thickness**: 3 thin layers > 1 thick layer
2. **External TCs**: Place TCs in honeycomb to prevent griefing
3. **No obvious paths**: Make raiders guess shortest route
4. **Vertical honeycomb**: Don't forget floors above/below
5. **Armored core**: Even with honeycomb, core should be sheet metal minimum

## Airlock Design

### Basic Airlock
- Two doors in sequence
- Small room between
- If one door breached, second still protects base

### Advanced Airlock (2025 Meta)
**Features**:
- Double doors OR windowed doors
- Peek-holes for visibility
- Identify friendlies without opening
- Shotgun trap aimed at entrance
- Ceiling turret looking down
- Murder holes for shooting invaders

**Layouts**:
1. **L-Shaped Airlock**: Turn corner between doors, prevents direct sight line
2. **Double-Airlock**: Two separate airlock systems (4 doors total)
3. **Trap Airlock**: Shotgun traps activate if both doors open simultaneously

## Bunker Designs

### Staircase Stability Bunker
- Uses staircase to hold up entrance
- Remove staircase = entrance seals
- No external door when closed
- Raiders waste explosives trying to find entrance

### Floor Bunker
- Half-floor blocks entrance
- Place/remove to open/close
- Requires exact positioning
- Can use twig floor (anyone can break to open)

### Wall Bunker
- Uses deployable (rug, sleeping bag) to hold up wall
- Remove deployable = wall collapses, creates entrance
- Less common in 2025 due to patches

## Defensive Features (2025)

### Essential Traps

#### Shotgun Traps
**Placement**:
- Above doorways (ceiling-mounted, angled down)
- Narrow hallways
- Around loot room doors
- TC room entrance

**Ammo**: 384 handmade shells (3min 12sec continuous fire)
**Range**: 4 meters
**Trigger**: Anyone not authorized to TC

#### Auto Turrets
**Placement**:
- High corners with wide view
- Overlapping fields of fire
- Loot room defense
- Roof positions

**Requirements**: 10 power, weapon + ammo, manual authorization (ignores TC)
**Pros**: Any ranged weapon can be used, high DPS
**Cons**: Expensive, requires power, needs ammo refills

#### Tesla Coils
**Placement**:
- Corridors
- Airlock areas
- Around TC

**Requirements**: 35 power
**Damage**: 35/second
**Range**: 3 meters (1 foundation)

#### Flame Turrets
**Placement**:
- Doorways
- Tight spaces
- Stairwells

**Features**:
- Area denial
- Low-grade fuel powered
- Causes panic
- Burns raiders alive

### Electrical Improvements (2025)
- Easier deployment and maintenance
- Better snap-to-grid options
- More reliable power systems

## Loot Distribution Strategy

### Never Store All Loot Together
**Bad**: Single massive loot room
**Good**: 4-6 smaller stashes

### Hidden Loot Locations
1. **Fake walls**: Use half-walls that look full
2. **Floor stashes**: Under foundations using triangle exploits
3. **External stashes**: Buried outside base perimeter
4. **Decoy rooms**: Obvious "loot room" with trash, real loot elsewhere
5. **Furnace bases**: Small separate bases disguised as furnace rooms
6. **Ceiling stashes**: Use multiple floors, hide between them

### Priority System
- **TC Room**: Only materials for upkeep + some basic resources
- **Primary Loot**: Weapons, armor, meds in separate hidden room
- **Secondary Loot**: Components, resources in 2-3 other rooms
- **Decoy**: Some OK loot in obvious "loot room" to satisfy small raids

## Peak-down Design

### Shooting Floor Mechanics
- Higher position = advantage
- Attackers can't see inside
- Defenders see everything
- Use windows, embrasures, or gaps

### Roof Design
- Ensure roof access from inside
- Half-walls for crouch-shooting
- Multiple angles to shoot from
- Easy retreat path to base interior

## Base Location Strategy

### Factors to Consider
1. **Monument proximity**: Near monuments = more traffic, faster farming
2. **Node access**: Metal/sulfur nodes nearby critical
3. **Biome**:
   - **Temperate**: Balanced, comfortable
   - **Snow**: Less traffic, more HQM, harsh environment
   - **Desert**: Hot, open, visible
4. **Visibility**: Hidden in trees/rocks vs. visible compound
5. **Terrain**: Flat for building vs. hills for advantage
6. **Neighbor density**: Avoid building too close to large clans

### Popular Spots (Risky)
- Near Launch Site
- Near Outpost/Bandit
- Between multiple monuments

### Quiet Spots (Safer)
- Deep forests in temperate zones
- Mountain valleys
- Away from roads and monuments
- Near map edges

## Raid Defense Tactics

### Offline Defense (Base Design)
- Honeycomb minimum 2 layers
- Traps everywhere
- Hidden TC
- Separated loot
- High raid cost-to-loot-value ratio

### Online Defense (Active)
- Roof access for shooting down
- Multiple exit points for flanking
- External bags nearby for respawns
- Allies with bags near your base
- Communication (Discord/in-game)
- Prepared counter-raid kits (weapons, ammo, meds)

### Counter-Raid Strategy
1. Don't fight inside base (raiders have advantage)
2. Respawn at external bag
3. Attack raiders from behind
4. Target their loot/deployment
5. Make raid not worth their time

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-TC Bases
- Use multiple TCs for complex builds
- Each TC covers different areas
- Raiders must find all TCs
- Allows creative shapes

### Asymmetrical Interiors
- Avoid patterns
- Random room sizes
- Unexpected layouts
- Confuses raiders on "optimal path"

### Armored Ceilings/Floors
- Often overlooked by defenders
- Raiders may go up/down instead of through walls
- Armored vertical layers critical for late-game

### Window Bars
- Embrasures allow shooting out, not in
- Great for defensive positions
- Can be used in airlocks

## 2025 Meta Lessons

1. **Compact and fully upgraded > large and weak**
2. **Trap integration is essential**, not optional
3. **TC protection is #1 priority** - armored + multiple layers
4. **Airlocks with visibility** - peek holes and windowed doors meta
5. **Stability bunkers still work** but require precise building
6. **Avoid cookie-cutter YouTube bases** - raiders memorize them
7. **Customize and adapt** - use guides as templates, then modify
8. **Economic raiding** - make your base "not worth it" to raid vs. value
