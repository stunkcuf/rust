# RUST Progression System

## Overview
RUST uses a multi-tiered progression system based on Workbenches, Tech Trees, and Blueprints. Players advance from primitive tools to high-tech weapons through scrap collection, research, and unlocking.

## Workbench Tiers

### Tier System
- **Basic**: No workbench - primitive items only
- **Tier 1**: Basic tools, clothing, and early weapons
- **Tier 2**: Mid-game weapons, armor, and components
- **Tier 3**: End-game weapons, explosives, and advanced items

### Workbench Crafting Requirements
| Tier | Materials | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Level 1 | 500 Wood, 100 Metal Fragments, 50 Scrap | First major milestone |
| Level 2 | 1,500 Wood, 500 Metal Fragments, 500 Scrap | Now unlocked via tech tree (2025 update) |
| Level 3 | 2,000 Wood, 1,000 Metal Fragments, 1,250 Scrap | Now unlocked via tech tree (2025 update) |

### Crafting Speed Bonuses
- Using a higher tier workbench than required speeds up crafting:
  - **1 tier above**: 50% faster crafting time
  - **2 tiers above**: 75% faster crafting time (maximum bonus)
- You must stay within range of the workbench for the duration

## Tech Tree System

### Overview
- Each workbench has its own independent tech tree (T1, T2, T3)
- Blueprints must be unlocked in linear order along connected paths
- Cannot skip items - must follow the progression lines
- Access tech tree by clicking "Use" on a workbench, then the green button

### Scrap Costs
- **Low tier items**: 20-50 scrap (basic clothing, furniture, simple weapons)
- **Mid tier items**: 75-125 scrap (medical syringes, gears, tools)
- **High tier items**: 125-500 scrap (advanced weapons, armor, explosives)
- **Total to unlock everything**: 25,872 scrap (all workbenches combined)
- **Tier 2 is most expensive**: Despite being mid-tier, T2 has the highest total cost due to number of items

### Recent Changes (2025)
- Workbenches T2 and T3 no longer require scrap to craft
- They are now locked behind tech tree unlocks
- Must unlock them before you can craft them

## Research Table

### Crafting
- **Cost**: 200 metal fragments, 20 scrap
- **Requirements**: Must be standing next to a Level 1 Workbench
- **Blueprint**: Default, no research needed

### How to Use
1. Place item you want to research in research table
2. Add required scrap amount
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Receive blueprint in return (original item is destroyed)
5. Either memorize blueprint (right-click) or store/trade it

### Research Costs by Tier
| Category | Scrap Range | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Basic | 20-50 | Cloth clothing, wooden furniture, basic weapons |
| Standard | 75-125 | Medical syringe (75), gears (75), jackhammer (125) |
| Advanced | 500 | Metal chest plate |
| Elite | 750+ | High external wall (750) |

**Total to research everything**: 19,985 scrap

### Alternative to Tech Tree
- Research table allows you to skip tech tree progression
- Must have the item you want to research
- More expensive but allows targeted unlocking
- Useful for items obtained from raids or trades

## Blueprint Experimentation

### Workbench Gambling
- Each workbench tier allows random blueprint gambling
- Place scrap in workbench to receive random same-tier blueprint

| Workbench | Scrap Cost | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Tier 1 | 75 | Random T1 blueprint (e.g., metal hatchet, revolver) |
| Tier 2 | 300 | Random T2 blueprint |
| Tier 3 | 750 | Random T3 blueprint |

### When to Use
- Early wipe when scrap is limited
- Looking for specific common items
- Gambling for key blueprints
- Generally less efficient than targeted research

## Blueprint Locations

### Monument Research Tables
- **Bandit Camp**: Second floor of "Stuff" vendor
- **Outpost**: Near recycler area
- **Various monuments**: Check larger monuments for research tables

### Blueprint Storage
- Blueprints can be stored in containers
- Can be traded between players
- Can be sold in vending machines
- Once memorized, blueprint is permanent (survives wipes on most servers)

## Progression Strategies

### Early Game (First Hour)
1. Gather basic resources (wood, stone, cloth)
2. Craft stone tools
3. Build small base with Tool Cupboard
4. Craft Level 1 Workbench
5. Farm scrap from roads and small monuments
6. Research or unlock key items: code lock, furnace, sleeping bag

### Mid Game (Hours 2-10)
1. Establish secure base with stone walls
2. Craft Level 2 Workbench
3. Farm monuments for components and scrap
4. Unlock weapon tech tree: revolvers, semi-auto rifle, Thompson
5. Research armor and better tools
6. Target: 5,000-10,000 scrap saved

### Late Game (Day 2+)
1. Upgrade to sheet metal/armored base
2. Craft Level 3 Workbench
3. Unlock end-game weapons: AK, LR-300, C4, rockets
4. Complete tech trees
5. Focus on raid defense and PVP

## Wipe Persistence

### What Wipes
- **Map Wipe**: All structures, items, loot (happens monthly minimum)
- **Blueprint Wipe**: All learned blueprints (periodic, varies by server)

### What Persists (No BP Wipe)
- Learned blueprints
- Skin collections
- Server reputation

### Server-Specific Rules
Always check server description for:
- Blueprint wipe schedule
- Progression modifiers (2x, 3x, 10x)
- Custom tech tree configurations
