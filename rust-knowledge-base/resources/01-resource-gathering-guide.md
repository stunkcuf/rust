# RUST Resource Gathering & Farming Guide

## Ore Nodes Overview

### Node Types

#### Stone Nodes
**Appearance**: Plain grayish color
**Yield**: Stone
**Health**: 500 HP
**Best Tool**: Salvaged Icepick (fastest), Stone Pickaxe (budget)

**Yields by Tool**:
- Rock: ~180 stone
- Stone Pickaxe: ~390 stone
- Pickaxe: ~485 stone
- Salvaged Icepick: ~600 stone (best)

#### Metal Ore Nodes
**Appearance**: Red/brown coloring
**Yield**: Metal Ore + small amount of HQM
**Health**: 500 HP
**Best Tool**: Salvaged Icepick

**Yields by Tool**:
- Rock: ~180 ore
- Stone Pickaxe: ~390 ore
- Pickaxe: ~485 ore
- Salvaged Icepick: ~600 ore

**Ratio**: ~1000 metal ore = ~10-15 HQM bonus

#### Sulfur Nodes
**Appearance**: Greenish-yellowish coloring
**Yield**: Sulfur Ore
**Health**: 500 HP
**Best Tool**: Salvaged Icepick

**Yields**: Same as metal nodes
**Use**: Gunpowder, explosives - ESSENTIAL for raiding

#### High Quality Metal (HQM) Nodes
**Appearance**: Silvery/bright metallic
**Yield**: HQM Ore primarily
**Location**: Snow biome and mountain tops ONLY
**Health**: 500 HP

**Yields**: Significantly more HQM per node
**Rarity**: Much rarer than other nodes

## Mining Mechanics

### Sweet Spot System
**Visual**: Orange glowing spot on node
**Effect**: Hit sweet spot = faster mining, more yield
**Location**: Rotates around node as you hit it

**Efficiency**:
- Hitting sweet spot: ~30% faster mining
- Missing sweet spot: Normal speed

**Tip**: Follow the orange glow, swing where it moves next

### Tool Comparison

| Tool | Speed | Yield | Durability | Cost |
|------|-------|-------|------------|------|
| Rock | Very Slow | Lowest | Infinite | Free |
| Stone Pickaxe | Slow | Low | 200 | 200 stone |
| Pickaxe | Medium | Good | 200 | 125 metal frags, 100 wood |
| Salvaged Icepick | Fast | Best | 250 | 5 metal blades, 1 pipe (T2) |
| Jackhammer | Fastest | Best | 250 | 150 scrap (Outpost) |

### Jackhammer
**Special**: Fastest mining, ignores sweet spot entirely
**Fuel**: None required
**Noise**: EXTREMELY LOUD - attracts players
**Cost**: 150 scrap at Outpost "Tools and Stuff" vending machine
**Cannot Craft**

**Best Use**:
- Secure area farming
- Inside base quarrying
- When speed > stealth

### Tea Boost
**Ore Tea**: Made from berries at mixing table
**Effect**: +50% ore yield from nodes
**Duration**: ~5 minutes

**Impact Example**:
- Normal: 600 ore per node
- With Tea: 900 ore per node

**Strategy**: Always use ore tea when farming nodes seriously

## Best Farming Locations

### Snow Biome
**Pros**:
- Abundant unharvested nodes (stone, metal, sulfur, HQM)
- Less player traffic
- Easier to spot nodes against white terrain
- HQM nodes exclusive here (and mountains)

**Cons**:
- Cold damage without proper clothing
- Harsh survival conditions
- Requires warmth management

**Gear Needed**:
- Heavy clothing OR hazmat (hazmat provides cold protection)
- Coffee Can Helmet
- Campfire or torch

### Mountain Areas
**Pros**:
- Metal and sulfur concentrated
- HQM spawns at peaks
- High ground visibility

**Cons**:
- Difficult terrain
- Fall damage risk
- Cold at high altitude

### Caves
**Pros**:
- Plentiful ore nodes
- Concealed from outside view
- Reduced player detection (earshot)
- Usually multiple node types

**Cons**:
- Dark (need torch)
- Easy to trap inside
- Animals spawn inside
- Claustrophobic

**Strategy**: Best risk-reward for solo farming

### The Large Excavator
**Location**: Unique monument (1 per map)
**Fuel**: Diesel fuel
**Output**: Massive ore quantities

**How It Works**:
1. Add diesel fuel to excavator
2. Select ore type (stone, metal, sulfur, HQM)
3. Activate excavator
4. Collect from output conveyor

**Output Rate**: 5,000-10,000+ ore in minutes (far exceeds manual)

**Risk**: MAXIMUM
- Extremely loud and visible
- Every player on the server will know
- Requires team to defend
- Attracts clans
- PVP guaranteed

**Best For**: Large clans with defense teams

### Map Edge Strategy
- Nodes respawn on timers
- Map edges less traveled
- Set up small "farm base" near rich area
- Store ore, smelt on site
- Transfer to main base periodically

## Wood Gathering

### Tree Types
**All trees**: Drop wood when hit or cut down
**Large trees**: More wood
**Small trees/bushes**: Less wood

### Tool Comparison

| Tool | Speed | Yield | Best Use |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| Rock | Very Slow | Low | Absolute emergency |
| Stone Hatchet | Slow | Medium | Early game |
| Hatchet | Medium | Good | Standard |
| Salvaged Axe | Fast | Better | Mid-late game |
| Chainsaw | Fastest | Best | Bulk farming |

### Chainsaw
**Fuel**: Low-grade fuel required
**Effect**: Ignores sweet spot, cuts extremely fast
**Noise**: EXTREMELY LOUD
**Cost**: Loot only OR tech tree unlock

**Pros**:
- Fastest wood gathering
- No aiming needed
- Can gather thousands quickly

**Cons**:
- Very loud (attracts players)
- Requires fuel
- Expensive to lose

**Best Use**: Safe base area, bulk wood needed

### Wood Farming Strategy
1. **Early game**: Stone hatchet, forests near base
2. **Mid game**: Hatchet, larger expeditions
3. **Late game**: Salvaged axe or chainsaw for bulk
4. **Always**: Hit sweet spot on trees (red X)

### Wood Storage
- 1 large wood box = 48 stacks = 144,000 wood
- Wood is bulky, dedicate storage
- Keep some in TC for upkeep always

## Animal Hunting

### Animal Types & Yields

#### Chickens
**HP**: Very low
**Drops**: Small amount of meat, cloth, bone fragments
**Difficulty**: Easy to kill
**Best For**: Quick cloth early game

#### Boars
**HP**: Low
**Drops**: More meat, cloth, leather, bone fragments
**Difficulty**: Easy, but may charge when hurt
**Best For**: Early game food and cloth

#### Deer
**HP**: Low
**Drops**: Good meat, cloth, leather, bone fragments
**Difficulty**: Easy, fast runners
**Best For**: Balanced resource gathering

#### Wolves
**HP**: Medium
**Aggro**: Aggressive, will chase and attack
**Drops**: Good meat, cloth, bone fragments, wolf skull
**Difficulty**: Medium - attacks first, deals damage
**Best For**: Leather, bone (if equipped)

#### Bears
**HP**: High (400+)
**Aggro**: Extremely aggressive, fast, deadly
**Drops**: Lots of meat, cloth, leather, bone, animal fat, bear skull
**Difficulty**: Hard - can kill geared players
**Best For**: High-risk, high-reward farming

#### Horses (Rideable)
**HP**: Medium
**Aggro**: Passive (wild ones)
**Drops**: Meat, leather, bone, cloth
**Best For**: Transportation (don't kill unless necessary)

### Hunting Tools

| Weapon | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Bow | All animals | Silent, cheap ammo |
| Crossbow | Medium-large | More damage than bow |
| Spear (thrown) | Small animals | One-shot chickens |
| Guns | Bears, wolves | Overkill but safer |
| Melee | Small animals | Risky for wolves/bears |

### Harvesting Tools

| Tool | Best For Gathering |
|------|-------------------|
| Hatchet | Meat |
| Pickaxe | Bone Fragments |
| Knife/Cleaver | Leather, cloth |
| Salvaged Tools | Best yields for each |

**Pro Tip**: Use hatchet on animals for max meat, knife for cloth/leather

## Cloth Farming

### Sources
1. **Hemp Plants**: Most efficient, 10 cloth per plant
2. **Animals**: Variable, 10-50 cloth depending on animal and tool
3. **Recycling**: Tarps, road signs, rope (less efficient)
4. **Barrels**: Random small amounts

### Hemp Locations
**Biome**: Everywhere EXCEPT snow biome
**Appearance**: Green tall plants along ground
**Respawn**: Fast

**Strategy**:
- Forest runs yield 500-1,000 cloth in 15 minutes
- Near rivers and roads
- Respawns every few minutes

### Sewing Kit
**Use**: Repair cloth items
**Cost**: 100 cloth, rope
**Don't waste cloth on**: Excessive clothing storage

## Resource Processing

### Furnaces

#### Small Furnace
**Capacity**:
- 3 slots (2 ore, 1 fuel)
- 1,000 wood fuel
- 2,000 total ore

**Speed**: Medium
**Best For**: Early-mid game

#### Large Furnace
**Capacity**:
- 6 slots (3 ore, 3 fuel)
- 5,000 wood fuel
- 6,000 total ore

**Speed**: Faster per slot
**Best For**: Bulk processing, bases with many furnaces

**Refining Ratios**:
- Metal Ore: 1 ore → 1 metal fragment
- Sulfur Ore: 1 ore → 1 sulfur
- HQM Ore: 1 ore → 1 HQM (rare, precious)

**Fuel Efficiency**:
- Crude Oil (best): Longest burn time
- Wood: Standard
- Low-grade fuel: Good but better used elsewhere

#### Refinery (Oil)
**Small Oil Refinery**:
- 3 Crude Oil → 10 Low Grade Fuel
- Uses wood as fuel
- Essential for vehicles, chainsaws, quarries

## Scrap Farming (Already covered in monuments, brief here)

### Primary Sources
1. **Barrels**: 1 scrap each (roads, monuments)
2. **Crates**: 5-25 scrap depending on type
3. **Recycling**: Components → scrap
4. **Scientists**: Corpses sometimes have scrap
5. **Vending machines**: Sell items to NPC vendors

### Recycling Priority

**Best Scrap Return**:
- Tech Trash: 50 scrap
- Rifle Body: 25 scrap
- SMG Body: 15 scrap
- Road Signs: 5 scrap each
- Tarps: 5 scrap
- Metal blades: 2 scrap
- Propane tanks: 50 scrap (early game recycle only)

**Don't Recycle** (usually):
- Gears (needed for crafting)
- Springs (needed for weapons)
- Pipes (needed for many items)
- Tech trash (unless desperate)

## Farming Strategy by Stage

### Primitive (First 10 minutes)
**Goals**: Stone, wood, hemp
**Tools**: Rock
**Strategy**:
- Hit trees/nodes near spawn
- Gather hemp for cloth
- Make stone tools ASAP

### Early Game (First hour)
**Goals**: Secure base, basic resources
**Tools**: Stone tools
**Strategy**:
- Build small base
- Farm wood (3,000+)
- Farm stone (5,000+)
- Farm metal ore (1,500+)
- Smelt metal for base upgrades

### Mid Game (Hours 2-10)
**Goals**: Expand base, gear up
**Tools**: Metal tools, maybe salvaged
**Strategy**:
- Farm sulfur for gunpowder/ammo
- Farm HQM for weapons
- Monument runs for scrap
- Hunt for food and cloth
- Process ores overnight

### Late Game (Day 2+)
**Goals**: Raid materials, maintain base
**Tools**: Salvaged or better, maybe jackhammer
**Strategy**:
- Sulfur farming for raids (10,000+)
- HQM for armored base upgrades
- Scrap for research
- Monument dominance
- Resource teas for efficiency

## Pro Tips

1. **Farm during off-hours**: Less competition, safer
2. **Stash frequently**: Don't carry everything, hide stashes
3. **Use teas**: 50% boost is massive over time
4. **Secure furnace bases**: Small hidden bases for smelting near farms
5. **Bring bag**: Place bag near farming area for respawn
6. **Listen**: Stop mining periodically to listen for players
7. **Don't be greedy**: Leave with half-full inventory if danger
8. **Recycle smart**: Know what to keep vs. scrap
9. **Ore priority**: Sulfur > Metal > Stone for most stages
10. **Snow runs**: Best ore/min but bring cold protection
